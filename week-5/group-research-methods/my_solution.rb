# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# .map!: Invokes the given block once for each element of self, replacing the element with the value returned by the block.
# .each: Calls the given block once for each element in self, passing that element as a parameter.
#
# Teach your accountability group how to use the methods
# Please visit http://ruby-doc.org/ in order to find related examples.
# Share any tricks you used to find and decipher the Ruby Docs
# Stackoverflow is also a good resource.
