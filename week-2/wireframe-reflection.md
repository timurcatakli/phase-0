### What is a wireframe?

It's like an architectural blueprint. It is an image or set of images which displays the functional elements of a website, mobile app or page, typically used for planning a site's structure and functionality.

It is very useful in determining how the user interacts with the interface. Wireframing is also important because it allows the designer to plan the layout and interaction of an interface without being distracted by colors, typeface choices or even copy. Like the foundation of a building, it has to be fundamentally strong before you decide whether to give it an expensive coat of paint.
