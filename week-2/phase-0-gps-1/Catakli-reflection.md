## My Reflection

#### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was mainly concerned with remembering the terminal commands.

#### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Collaborator concept was new and it was clarified. Rest was the old stuff.

#### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked the guide about one or two terminal commands. I asked my pair about how he is doing, his preference about driving or navigating.

#### What still confuses you about git?
Branche merging locally and remotely.

#### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was OK...
