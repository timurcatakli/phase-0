<h1>Programming and Software Development Related Subreddits</h1>

<article>
	<h2>This is a subheading</h2>

	<p>Like thousands of others, I personally love Reddit, too. To the untrained eye, Reddit looks like a 90s site. A mess — text links, comment threads, points, upvotes, downvotes. At best, posts seem contextless — at worst, totally random.</p>

	<p>But spend some quality time with “The Front Page of the Internet,” and you’ll find it’s an essential resource, a self-correcting marketplace of ideas that’s nearly impervious to marketers.</p>

<p>In Reddit there are tens of niche communities, called Subreddits. You can subscribe to those subreddits, which will push popular posts from those channels to your homepage. You can always browse those individual subreddits directly, of course.</p></article>

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I used: h1, h2 title tags and also used the article semantic html5 tag. h1 title tags and the paragraph tag are the ones I keep using as they are the most comment for content.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are get laid out based on the coding order. But I think CSS position property will change all that.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I loved snippets. I think I will create more of them... -->
